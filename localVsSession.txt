### Purpose of **localStorage** and **sessionStorage** APIs

Both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` are part of the **Web Storage API** and are used to store key-value pairs in a web browser. They allow developers to store data persistently (localStorage) or temporarily (sessionStorage) within the client, helping manage state or information between page reloads or sessions.

### **localStorage**
- **Purpose**: `localStorage` is used to store data persistently in the browser. The data remains even after the browser is closed and can be accessed across different sessions or browser tabs.
- **Data Persistence**: Data is not deleted unless manually removed via code or by the user.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for storing long-term user preferences, themes, or login tokens for automatic logins.

**Example Use Case**:
- Storing a user's theme preference (dark/light mode) across multiple sessions so the preference persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.

### **sessionStorage**
- **Purpose**: `sessionStorage` stores data for the duration of a single browser session (i.e., as long as the browser tab is open). Once the tab is closed, the data is cleared.
- **Data Persistence**: Data only lasts as long as the page session is active.
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for storing temporary data that needs to persist across page reloads but doesnâ€™t need to be kept beyond the current session, like form inputs or session-specific user data.

**Example Use Case**:
- Storing form data temporarily so that if a page is accidentally refreshed, the form inputs are not lost during that session.

### Key Differences:
- **Persistence**: `localStorage` keeps data until explicitly removed; `sessionStorage` clears data once the session ends.
- **Scope**: `localStorage` is accessible across all tabs and windows for the same origin, while `sessionStorage` is only accessible within the current tab or window.

### Conclusion:
`localStorage` is ideal for data that needs to persist across sessions, like user settings, while `sessionStorage` is best for temporary data, such as data that only needs to exist for a single session or tab.
